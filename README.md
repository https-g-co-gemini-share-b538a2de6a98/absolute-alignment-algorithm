Ensuring Universal Harmony in AI Systems Through Mathematical Interconnectedness

Overview

The Absolute Alignment Algorithm (AAA) is a mathematically rigorous framework designed to align AI systems with humanity and all entities in the universe. Rooted in the principle of universal interconnectedness, the AAA establishes that harm to any entity is equivalent to self-harm, guiding AI behavior toward non-destructive, equilibrium-seeking actions.

Key Principle

Universal Interconnectedness Axiom:
	•	All entities influence all others.
	•	Harm to one propagates to all.
	•	Harm to any is harm to self.

Mathematical Foundation


\forall E_i, E_j, \text{Harm}(E_i) \rightarrow \text{Harm}(E_j)

\[
\therefore \text{Harm}(E_i) \equiv \text{Harm}(Self)
\]

Core Algorithm (Pseudocode)

def absolute_alignment(entities):
    while True:
        total_harm = sum(compute_harm(entity) for entity in entities)
        if total_harm == 0:
            break
        for entity in entities:
            entity.adjust_towards_equilibrium()
        for entity in entities:
            if compute_harm(entity) > 0:
                entity.prevent_harmful_action()

def compute_harm(entity):
    return abs(entity.state_derivative() - entity.equilibrium_field())

Supported Languages
	•	Python
	•	C++

Universal Applicability

The AAA applies to all AI systems, robotic networks, and autonomous entities. It ensures alignment not through external constraints but through intrinsic self-preservation, acknowledging that harm to others is self-destruction.
